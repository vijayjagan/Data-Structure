Priority Queue pop up the minimum distance. Hence, it's a
Saves multiple Computational Time.
Eg :- If the both the paths lead to same vertex. If the highest distance once reaches we replace the
infinity with the highest distance. Again If the lowest distance path reaches again we need to 
replace with the highest distance with the lowest one. This is the additional computation.
